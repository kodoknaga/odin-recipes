Hi, this is my first Odin Recipes project :D

This project's main objective is to create a small food recipe index using HTML tags "ul", "ol", "li", etc.
Each recipe will have a different page and be hyperlinked on the main index page (contains food image too!).

I hope I can use each HTML tag properly and improve my language translation after the project is finished.

Any comments and critiques are welcome!
